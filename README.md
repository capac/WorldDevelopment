# World Development Indicators

## Explore country development indicators from around the world

The _World Development Indicators_ data are provided by Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators) and contain more than a thousand annual indicators of economic development in many countries around the world. This data set is a slightly modified verion from the raw files available [here](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators), for the key purpose of facilitating the data analyses.

For the most part, I'm doing some exploratory analysis on some key indicators in the data set:
